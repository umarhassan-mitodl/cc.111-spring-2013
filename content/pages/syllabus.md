## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week; 1.5 hours / session

## The Concourse Program

This course is part of the [Concourse](https://concourse.mit.edu/) program at MIT. Concourse is a unique program for freshmen. It focuses on integration of the disciplines, teaching the rigorous scientific subjects within the broader human framework. Classes are taught by highly dedicated teachers in an interactive learning environment with small class sizes. This creates a high degree of student-faculty, and student-student interaction and therein a superior learning experience.

## Prerequisite

None, but there is a corequisite with [CC.011 Seminar II](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/mCCa.html#CC.011).

## Course Overview

This course investigates the philosophic basis of our modern way of life. We will first examine the philosophic foundations of modernity—the "Enlightenment"-in the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. We will then turn to the Constitution, the debates over its establishment, and Tocqueville's reflections on the regime it created. Through these texts, we will see trace the Founders' attempts to put enlightenment philosophy into practice, and we will see how notions of freedom, so crucial to this modern philosophic project, inspire and sustain the American experiment. Since the Constitution only launched the endeavor, we next study the way in which great American statesmen understood and conducted this experiment in liberty and popular sovereignty. We conclude with works by the 18{{< sup "th" >}} century philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the19{{< sup "th" >}} century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, both of whom offer sharp criticism of the Enlightenment project.

## Requirements

Response papers to weekly study questions will be due the first class of each week after the first week. Students will also submit three essays of approximately seven pages (1500-2000 words). The first will be re-written and re-submitted. In addition, each student will be responsible for a 10–minute oral presentation on one of the study questions at some point in the semester.
