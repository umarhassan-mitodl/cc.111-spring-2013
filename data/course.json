It investigates how these obligations are captured in the principles of our political associations. This course also studies how the centrality of freedom plays out in the political thought of such authors as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke and Montesquieu, as well as debating which notions of freedom inspire and sustain the American experiment by careful reading of the documents and arguments of the founding of the United States.\n\nThis course is part of the {{% resource_link \"77b26271-789d-41a8-831a-5810384b5e48\" \"Concourse\" %}} program at MIT.",
